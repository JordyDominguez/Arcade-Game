## Instructions

Click on two cards to try to match the symbols. If they do not match the cards will shake red and then flip back over. If the cards do match the cards will pulse blue and the cards will remain out. Match all of the cards to win.

## What to Expect

The goal of the game is to reach the end of the beach as many times as you can before you lose all of your lives. The game starts you out with 5 boats, if you get hit by a crab or shark you lose a life (boat). Reaching the deep water gets you 1 point, while collecting a diamond gives you 3. So try your best to rack up as many points as you can before you get lost at sea!
